# How to contribute

## Describe everything properly
* Make sure to properly fill out the pull request and issue templates
* Ambiguous changes with no explanation will be rejected.

## Make sure to follow existing coding conventions

The most important conventions to upkeep if you don't want your PR rejected:
* 4 spaces per indent level for code, 2 spaces per indent level for json, yaml, etc.
* Parentheses/Brackes/Braces open on the same line, not on a new line
* Method arguments are lists, not paragraphs. Either ALL arguments go on the same line, or every argument goes a SEPARATE line.
* Not everyone has an ultrawide monitor. Try to keep lines below 120 characters in length.
* Do not reformat existing code. Reformatting is done exclusively by the maintainers.
* Annotations have one parameter per line, no exceptions
* Do not pollute the repo with IDE-specific configuration files.
