A library used by some of my other mods.

CurseForge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falsepatternlib

The primary feature of this mod is version-safe dependency handling of non-mod libraries. FalsePatternLib can dynamically load dependencies from a specific maven repository, which lets mods that use external dependencies to share said dependency, instead of shadowing it in for each individual mod. This leads to way smaller jar files, and an extremely low chance of dependency conflicts.

Dependencies:

None
